Barber Project

A modern, responsive website built for a local barber shop. This project was created to practice full‑stack fundamentals, clean UI structure, and real‑world project workflows.

✂️ For Da Barber

This project simulates a real barber shop website that could be used to:

Showcase services and pricing

Highlight the brand and vibe of the shop

Serve as a foundation for online booking and customer engagement

The goal was to keep it clean, minimal, and easy for both customers and barbers to understand.

🛠 Technologies

HTML5 – semantic structure

CSS3 – layout, responsiveness, and styling

JavaScript (ES6+) – interactivity and logic

React – component‑based UI

Vite – fast development server and build tool

Git & GitHub – version control

✨ Features

Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

Clean landing/home page

Reusable React components

Modern folder structure

Fast development workflow using Vite

🧠 Creation Process

Planned the layout and basic user flow (home → services → contact)

Set up the project using Vite + React

Built the UI with reusable components

Focused on clean file structure and readability

Iterated through debugging, styling, and refactoring

This project was built incrementally, treating it like a real client project rather than a tutorial clone.

📚 What I Learned

How to properly set up and troubleshoot a Vite + React project

The importance of project structure when scaling

Debugging common environment and dependency issues

Translating a real‑world business into a web interface

Using Git effectively across multiple machines

📈 Overall Growth

This project helped bridge the gap between tutorials and real projects. I became more confident in:

Building from scratch without step‑by‑step guidance

Solving errors independently

Thinking like a developer instead of just following instructions

It represents a major step in my transition toward full‑stack development.

🚀 How It Can Be Improved

Add online booking functionality separate from booksy

Integrate a backend (Node.js / Express)

Store appointments in a database

Improve accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
